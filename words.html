	Sumosonic
	<b>This is Sumo</b>
	(Creation Records)
	<p>
	To call Pat Fish the best British songwriter of the past
	fifteen years is an invitation for some awfully suspicious stares.
	Pat who?  But he might be just that.  Known since the early 1980s
	as the Jazz Butcher, Fish remained detached enough to avoid the
	indie-rock vortex of the last decade, dooming himself to obscurity
	while leaving behind one of the most valuable buried treasures in
	all of alternative music.  
	<p>
	Fish has joined with an all-new cast to form Sumosonic.  In what
	may be a disappointment to long-time Jazz Butcher fans (they're
	out there), this inaugural disk is decidedly un-Butcheresque, with
	a keyboard-heavy attack of quasi-techno rhythms.  Pat was known
	to dabble in reverb and noise, but the results were moody, melancholy
	textures, quite unlike the flash of This is Sumo.
	<p>
	Never quite dance music, the tight compositions and good-natured
	feistiness are a bit too mischievous for outright club-fare.
	Consider the tongue-in- cheek ferocity of 'Monks of Kung Fu,'
	(which some might liken to the Butcher's 'Do the Bubonic Plague,')
	with its melodic grunting and hilarious Chinese sampling.  At times,
	like on the gentle 'Cat's Life,' it's reminiscent of New Order-style
	synth-pop, with dreamy, entrancing swirls set to a pulse- quickening
	backbeat.  The snappy chorus of 'Come Friendly Spacemen' will have
	you wearing out the repeat button, as will the balmy spells of
	'Stupid,' and 'Destroy All Monsters' which are at once energetic
	and disarmingly sweet.  The syrupy 'Sputnik,' meanwhile, is the
	prettiest thing we've heard since 1993's 'Whaddya?'  Fish is no
	less graceful with keyboards and effects than he was with acoustic
	guitar.  
	<p>
	Considering Pat's long and productive past, it's hard to judge This
	is Sumo as a true 'debut'.  But let's not get caught on Sumo-semantics.
	No matter his band-mates or current moniker, the man still has genius
	to share.

	The world don't get any smaller than a world of your own.
	<br>The world don't get any smaller - we just stay closer to home.
	<br>There are ten million people the other side of that door,
	<br>and every one wants something from a world that's shrunk to nothing.
	<p>
	So what could you expect if I promised you the world?
	<br>What would you have left if I promised you the world?
	<p>
	This world don't get any smaller - that's just one of their lies.
	<br>The world don't get any smaller - it stays the same size.
	<br>If you could stand in my corner and see the world that I've known,
	<br>You'd understand why I'm alone.  The lights are on, but no one's home.
	<p>
	So what could you expect if I promised you the world?

	<br>Out of the rat-race, keeping to my own pace,
	<br>I never remember names, but I recognise the face.
	<br>Help you out here?  No - I couldn't do that;
	<br>I've been alone too long, I think like a cat.
	<br>I've got a cat's life.  Can you really say that's life?
	<br>An air of despair you can cut with a pen-knife?
	<br>What you want is what I despise.
	<br>I see in the dark, coz the light hurts my eyes.
	<br>Light hurts my eyes and my eyes hurt me:
	<br>I can't bear to look upon the things I see.
	<br>I see human vermin in a world of sin -

	So what did you expect but a cat's life?
	<br>What do you have left but a cat's life?

	<br>Are you never appalled at the things that you see?
	<br>Are you hiding away?  Do you know what I mean
	<br>When I say are you scared, are you hurt, are you burned or are you living a cat's life?
	<p>
	Ah, look at you - what did you expect but a cat's life?
	<br>Ah, look at you - what did you expect but a cat's life?

	The satellites that circle us are witness to God's grace:
	<br>He could pluck them from their orbits, cast them into Outer Space,
	<br>But he lets them keep revolving as the Earth moves round the Sun,
	<br>The only truly brilliant thing we've ever done.
	<p>
	Photographs of his creation - all the seas and land,
	<br>Beamed to us from our space station help us understand.
	<br>And the ladies in Los Angeles and the gentlemen in Perth
	<br>See them up there, circling the Earth.
	<p>
	Take the People's Train to the Academy of Science.
	<br>Use the People's instruments, do the People's work:
	<br>Put it up there, circling the Earth.
	<p>
	We all know the space heroes like
	<a href="http://nauts.com/histpace/vehicles/histvostok.html">Yuri Gargarin</a>,
	<br>But unknown thousands gave their lives to bring us this machine.
	<br>Now everybody knows what their sacrifice was worth,
	<br>Coz it's up there, and it's circling the Earth.
	<p>
	The satellites that circle us shine brightly as Big Stars,
	<br>They can see the Memphis soul men driving in their Big Black Cars,
	<br>And if you call them on the phone you might just hear the sound
	<br>Of the satellites as they go round and round.
	<p>
	Hear your voice repeating when you're talking on the phone,
	<br>Know that they are up there, know that we are not alone.
	<br>And one day we'll all know what this life of ours is worth
	<br>Coz they're up there, circling the Earth.
	<p>
	Circling the Earth (x3)
	<br>For ever
	<br>For ever
	<br>Circling the Earth
